Marcel is your work-colleague and can discuss with you regarding the content of the PDF you upload.

Initially forked from: https://github.com/kaifcoder/gemini_multipdf_chat

Improvements from the initial repo:
- changed entirely how Langchain is used to enable Marcel to take into account all the conversation not only the current question;
- changed prompt;
- code refactoring;
- removed "clear chat history"
